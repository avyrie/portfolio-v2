                    <p>Hello! My name is Ally and I am a Software Engineer currently living in Denver, CO. While I specialize in Front-End and Full-Stack technologies, I have a great passion for learning and creating innovative products and applications. I pride myself on being flexible and adaptable amongst the ever-changing environment of the tech industry.

                    <p>
                    I have been working professionally since the age of 13. Prior to working in software, my past work experience has included customer service, administration assistance, social media control, data entry, and animal care. Post-high school, I was accepted into and attended Coastal Carolina University for Marine Science and later transferred to George Mason University where I went on to achieve my BS in Biology. I later went on to graduate from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program. These expereinces granted me a plethora of skills that I have found useful across multiple industries.

                                <p class="proj-desc">Tandem Trivia was a trivia game created as a coding-challenge submission to Tandem's apprenticeship program. This application was created over the course of about four days using JavaScript, React.js, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. The prompt for this challenge was to create a trivia app that displays trivia questions with multiple-choice answers to select from. At minimum, the player can view the question(s), the answer choices, the correct answer upon submission, and their score. A round of trivia has 10 questions, all questions are multiple-choice, trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers are provided via a JSON file, questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time, questions should not repeat in a round, a user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers, the correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer and a user can see the score they received at the end of the round.

Each person was placed into one of five teams made up of software developers and user experience designers. The prompt of this hackathon was Election 2020 with an emphasis on bipartisanship. My team chose to focus on a project that would help engage younger and possible unregistered voters and encourage them to register to vote if they have not already done so. tweet2020 is a quiz app that shows the user a tweet from an unidentifiable source and prompts them to select a guess as to which 2020 presidential candidate tweeted it. At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to tweet their score and each page has a button which, when clicked, will redirect the user to vote.org's page to check your registration status. This project was created and completed over the course of three days with the collaboration of three software developers and four UX designers using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, and was deployed with netlify.</p>

Working with two other randomly-assigned software engineers, we were given a client and existing wireframes/user stories for a prospective travel app where users can leave reviews for a handful of pre-selected cities. We had multiple clarification meetings with this client to ensure they would be completely satisfied with the finished product. We created this project over the course of four week days using Django, Python, Pillow, Paperclip, Bulma, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript and was deployed using Heroku. This project was the most challenging assignment during my time thus far with General Assembly as it involved many different and specific requirements that were expected to be copleted over a short time-frame. However, my group was populated with talented and driven individuals and we produced a complete and extremely functional app.</p>

This project was created over a week and included the use of HTML5, EJS, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, DOM manipulation, MongoDB, Mongoose, Nodemailer, and Multer. This mock-page was created to display an animal rescue group. You can view animals available for adoption and specify by location. When you select an animal, the site redirects you to that animal's show page where you can opt to "adopt" that pet where you will be asked to enter your name and e-mail. Once this is completed, an e-mail is sent to the entered e-mail congratulating you on your request for adoption. There is an option to register with the site which gives you "admin privileges" so you may add a pet, edit a pet, or delete a pet. This project was a big undertaking given the class progress up to that point and working with my incredibly-talented partner was a fantastic experience. </p>

                                <p class="proj-desc">TrailStamp was my final project with General Assembly and my first solo full-stack project. This MERN stack application was created over the course of a week using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js. The purpose of this project was to provide a "stamp card" application where users could add hikes that they have either been on or would like to go on and provide an option for them to rate and review the hike once they have completed it. This application was created with full CRUD abilities.</p>

                                <p class="proj-desc">The Tamagotchi project was the first solo project I completed during my time taking General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. This project was created over a week and included the use of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. It is similar to the classic Tamagotchi game as you can feed your pet, play with your pet, and put your pet to sleep using on-screen buttons that decrement your pet's stats by 1 with each click. Your pet ages over time and, if the timer runs out or one of the stats reaches 10, your pet dies. Animation on screen shows your pet evolving over time and, in the end, passing away. I intentionally used a cheery and inviting color palette as this classic game was very nostalgic and wholesome for me and I wanted to reflect that feeling in the aesthetic.</p>

                                <p class="proj-desc">This project was a collaboration project between the Software Engineering and UX/UI Design immersive courses at General Assembly. Teams were randomly assigned a mix of UX/UI and Software Engineering students. A random prompt was given with the parameters being the application had to have a landing page, an option to "sign up" for the site (add inputted data to the database), a page to view information of "users" who have "signed up", be accessible, and be mobile-friendly. This project was created in less than 24 hours with a team of two designers and three engineers. My team went above and beyond the prompt creating an entire semi-functioning site. User info can be viewed and text verification was initiated. This project was another huge undertaking given the time constraints and I am so proud of my team for what we were able to achieve in such a short time-period.</p>
